# Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

## Key Points of the MVC Pattern

1. **Separation of Concerns:**
   - MVC pattern divides an application into three main interconnected components: Model, View, and Controller. This separation helps in managing the complexity of large applications by keeping the concerns of data (Model), presentation (View), and user input (Controller) separate.

2. **Model:**
   - Represents the application's data and business logic. It directly manages the data, logic, and rules of the application. The model is independent of the user interface.

3. **View:**
   - Displays the data to the user. It is the user interface of the application. The view gets the data from the model to generate the user interface.

4. **Controller:**
   - Acts as an intermediary between Model and View. It listens to the input from the View, processes it (using the Model), and returns the output display to the View. The controller updates the model based on user actions and selects the view to display the data.

5. **Maintainability:**
   - By separating the application into three components, the MVC pattern makes it easier to manage and update the application. Changes in the user interface don't affect the data logic and vice versa.

6. **Testability:**
   - Each component of the MVC pattern can be tested independently. The separation of concerns allows for more straightforward unit testing of each component.

7. **Reusability:**
   - The MVC pattern promotes reusability of components. The same model can be used with different views, or the same view can be used with different models.
